	  <h1>A Most Fallen Lady Delivered by Observing K&#257;rttika-vrata</h1>
	</header>

	  <p>
	    In ancient times there was a <em>br&#257;hma&#7771;a</em> by the name of Buddhu in the state of Dravi&#7693;a.  Due to her association, her husband's life span was reduced and he died prematurely.  After the death of her husband she became even more adulterous and felt no shame even though she was criticised by her community.  She had no son or brother and sustained herself by begging rice.  She never cooked for herself and often ate rice which had been cooked the previous day.  Furthermore, she never visited any holy places nor heard any <em>Pur&#257;&#7771;as</em>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    One day a <em>br&#257;hma&#7771;a</em> named Kutsa, who was performing <em>t&#299;rtha-y&#257;tr&#257;</em>, came to her house.  When Kutsa saw that this lady was fully engrossed in adulterous activities, he felt compassion for her and said, &#34;Oh, foolish woman! You must listen to my advice very carefully and attentively.  Why are you maintaining this material body which is made of five elements such as earth, water, fire, air, and ether (space) and which is filled with puss and blood?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This body is like a water bubble and one day it must be destroyed.  If you accept this temporary body as eternal, then through proper understanding you must remove this misconception which has been sitting within your mind.  You should meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead and listen to His pastimes with great attention.  During the month of K&#257;rttika, for the pleasure of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7771;u, you should take an early bath daily, give charity, offer a lamp, circumambulate Lord Vi&#7779;&#7771;u and offer <em>pra&#7771;&#257;mas</em> to Him.  All these activities will free you fromt he reactions to the many sinful activities you have committed.&#34;  Having spoken these words, Kutsa <em>br&#257;ma&#7771;a</em> left her house.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    After hearing the instructions of Kutsa, the <em>br&#257;hma&#7771;&#299;</em> began to repent for all her sinful activities and decided to observe the K&#257;rttika-vrata.  When the month of K&#257;rttika started, she observed the K&#257;rttika-vrata by taking early morning bath and offering a lamp daily to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7771;u.  Then after some time, when her lifespan was finished, she left her body.  After her death she was promoted to the heavenly planets and after enjoying heavenly pleasure she was liberated.  Any person who observes the K&#257;rttika-vrata and offers a lamp every day will be delivered by hearing this pastime.
